# 3D-Animation-Portfolio
The personal portfolio website is a modern, responsive, and animated web application designed to showcase personal skills, projects, and contact details in a visually engaging manner. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the portfolio focuses on smooth interactions, dynamic animations, and a clean UI/UX design inspired by minimalism and motion effects.

The project integrates GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for advanced scroll-based and timeline animations, providing a professional and interactive browsing experience. The theme toggle feature allows users to switch seamlessly between dark and light modes, ensuring accessibility and visual comfort. Additionally, the website includes a custom preloader, animated hero section, interactive skill bars, and scroll-triggered section transitions.

Each section — Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact — has been designed to maintain coherence and aesthetic appeal. The 3D model integration via Spline adds a futuristic touch to the design, making the portfolio stand out. The contact form is functional and animated, offering real-time success feedback on submission, along with social media links for direct connectivity.

The website is fully responsive, ensuring smooth usability across all devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It uses modern front-end practices such as localStorage-based theme persistence, flexbox/grid layouts, and GSAP-powered animation triggers to enhance performance and interactivity.
